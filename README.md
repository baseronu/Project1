* 58% private insurance (6% individual market, 49% coverage provided by an employer)


* Among this 49% of coverage provided by employer, 60% of them partially or fully self funded by employer, therefore they dont buy insurace from health insurance carrier. Enroller will have Humana, Anthem but it is the employers money that pays fro claim. Insurance company just administer the benefit.

* Medical Loss Ratio... Insurers that sell individual and small group health insurance coverage must spend 80% of premiums on medical calims and quality improvements. Not more than 20 percent can be sepend ont administartive costs including salaries and profits. Large group should spend 85% to the members.
