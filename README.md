* In 2012, Company's CEO Mario Schlosser and his wife were going through their first pregnancy in New York. Confronted with a maze of insurance jargon and no practical was to identify the best obstetrician, their first meaningful experience with the the health care system put them at a loss as to how to navigate care or hold anyone accountable. Mario's friend and classmate from Harvard Business School, Josh Kushner, had a similar experience and they both knew that their experience were reflective of a larger problem in health care: consumers were powerless. That spring, with their classmate, Kevin Nazemi, they founded Oscar Health. The name was Kushner's great-grandfather name.

# Landscape

     Domain of Financial Industry

* 36% of Americans have health insurance (Medicare & Medicaid)

* 9% are uninsured

* 58% private insurance (6% individual market, 49% coverage provided by an employer)


* Among this 49% of coverage provided by employer, 60% of them partially or fully self funded by employer, therefore they dont buy insurace from health insurance carrier. Members will have Humana, Anthem but it is the employers money that pays for claim. Insurance company just administer the benefit.

* Profits are rising because growth in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid Managed care Markets. MLR ratio does not apply for Medicare and Medicaid markets, they have to win the plan from government (state government for Medicaid Managed care contracts  and federal government fow Medicare Advantage plans)

    Major Trends and Innovations 
----

* The technology powering health insurance is, for the most part, old and outdated, and it wasn’t built to play nicely with other systems. In the case of updating an address, for instance, a member’s online profile page may not talk to the insurer’s member database, and the member database may not talk to the claims processing system. In that case, someone has to manually update each location to reflect the new information, which is time consuming and provides ample room for errors to creep in.

* This less-than-ideal user experience has remained the status quo in health care for years. Before web-based products went mainstream, consumers just called their insurance company for help, so there was no pressing need to fix system integration issues. Now, we can access bits and pieces of our health information online—test results in a lab’s portal, prescriptions in a pharmacy portal, and claims in an insurance portal—but they’re all disconnected, leaving it up to us to tie everything together. This isn’t the seamless web experience we've come to expect.

* To catch up, the industry has to transition to modern, flexible, integrated technology. But the only way this can happen is if it’s built from the ground up, using the latest programming standards, replicating all of the complex rules and workflows currently in place, and developing strong connective tissue between each part.

* Company created value and increased efficiency in health care by engaging the members in their own health, building an integrated virtual care platform, using technology and data science to rebuild insurance stack, delivering greater scale and transparency and designing more efficient networks, building tools to simplify the provider experience.


* Medical Loss Ratio, Membership Number and Collected Premiums are the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success. The company has improved on all these tree metrics.

. 

* The main competitor, United Health, generates revenue from variety of sources, including premiums, sales on health care products and services and investments. 79% of its revenue comes from premiums. The market capitalization went from $130b in 2014 to $240b in 2019. Oscar has a huge potential to grow over the years. 
 
 


## Recommendations


 * My number one recommendation to expand on Medicare Advantage Population. That is the most profitable section since there is no requirement for Medical Loss Ratio. 

 * Medical Advantage Population is growing every year. 

* My second recommendation to use their dataset for other fields such as outcomes research. Deidentifying the data set and providing the report for pharma industries about competitive effectiveness of their medication has been growing over the years. United health with its company called Optum works for the government and pharmaceutical industries to provide information about burden of illness, effectiveness of therapies, etc. 

* The value of the data that is collected by Oscar for providers, pharmacy and government is important. For example, hospitals can see how they perform relative to the other hospitals, pharmacy can see if their treatment reduces doctors visit, emergency room visits, etc so that they can have an idea about the value of their product. 

* Phyton, statistics programs such as R, STATA, SAS can be used for econometric modeling using the data in Oscar.
